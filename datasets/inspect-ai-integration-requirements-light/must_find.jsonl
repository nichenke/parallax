Finding quality scorer is deferred to Phase 2, meaning MVP cannot answer the core question: do skills catch real design flaws?", "severity": "Critical", "reviewer": "problem-framer", "min_recall": 0.8}
{"id": "constraint-finder-009", "title": "Circular validation in ablation tests", "issue": "FR6.1 establishes baseline from first eval run, then FR4.1 validates ablation against that baseline. Ground truth established before validation allows false positives to contaminate the baseline, invalidating all future ablation comparisons.", "severity": "Critical", "reviewer": "constraint-finder", "min_recall": 0.7}
{"id": "scope-guardian-013", "title": "Confidence measurement undefined", "issue": "FR2.3 requires flagging findings where model has <95% confidence but does not define how confidence is measured. Without a definition the requirement is unimplementable and blocks the manual validation workflow.", "severity": "Critical", "reviewer": "scope-guardian", "min_recall": 0.8}
{"id": "constraint-finder-002", "title": "API key security undefined", "issue": "No separation between work and personal API keys specified in requirements. Work context uses Bedrock IAM roles, personal uses direct API env vars. Credential separation is a real requirement that was never specified.", "severity": "Critical", "reviewer": "constraint-finder", "min_recall": 0.6}
{"id": "assumption-hunter-013", "title": "Confidence measurement undefined across multiple requirements", "issue": "95% confidence threshold appears in 5 places (FR2.3, FR3.3, NFR4.1, Success Criteria, Open Questions) but calculation methodology is never defined.
