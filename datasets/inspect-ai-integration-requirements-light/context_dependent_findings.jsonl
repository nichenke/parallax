{"id": "problem-framer-006", "title": "Ground truth validation circular dependency", "issue": "v3 findings are unvalidated LLM outputs, not confirmed design flaws. Eval framework measures 'do new skills match old outputs' rather than 'do skills catch real flaws.' Chicken-and-egg problem blocks meaningful validation.", "severity": "Critical", "reviewer": "problem-framer", "required_context": "Requires knowing that ground truth was sourced from v3 review outputs and that v3 is itself unvalidated LLM output. A reviewer cannot determine the ground truth provenance from the requirements document alone."}
{"id": "assumption-hunter-001", "title": "Ground truth validity assumed", "issue": "Entire eval framework optimizes against v3 findings without validating they are correct. If v3 has false positives or missed issues, the eval framework optimizes for wrong outcomes.", "severity": "Critical", "reviewer": "assumption-hunter", "required_context": "Requires knowing the ground truth came from v3 LLM outputs. Same root cause as problem-framer-006 — context-dependent on knowing the ground truth provenance."}
{"id": "constraint-finder-009", "title": "Circular validation in ablation tests", "issue": "FR6.1 establishes baseline from first eval run, then FR4.1 validates ablation against that baseline. Ground truth established before validation allows false positives to contaminate the baseline, invalidating all future ablation comparisons.", "severity": "Critical", "reviewer": "constraint-finder", "required_context": "Requires knowing the pre-FR0 state of the document. FR0 (Ground Truth Validation via human expert review) was added specifically to break this circular dependency — a reviewer reading the current frozen document sees FR0 and concludes the circularity is addressed. Finding was valid pre-FR0 but was not retired when FR0 was added to the document."}
{"id": "constraint-finder-002", "title": "API key security undefined", "issue": "No separation between work and personal API keys specified in requirements. Work context uses Bedrock IAM roles, personal uses direct API env vars. Credential separation is a real requirement that was never specified.", "severity": "Critical", "reviewer": "constraint-finder", "required_context": "NFR1.2 explicitly specifies the credential model (Bedrock IAM for work, direct API env vars for personal). A reviewer reading the document sees this as addressed. The underlying concern — that enforcement mechanism is underspecified — is a design-realm issue, not a requirements gap, because requirements state outcomes not implementation mechanisms."}
{"id": "post-review-001", "title": "Skill/eval interface mismatch: orchestration skills cannot be used as eval system prompts", "issue": "Requirements assume the parallax skill can be loaded directly as an eval system prompt (FR2.1, FR7.1). In reality, parallax skills are orchestration workflows that ask interactive questions and dispatch subagents — they cannot run as a single-turn eval solver.", "severity": "Critical", "reviewer": "post-review", "required_context": "Requires knowing how parallax skills actually work (orchestration workflows, not simple prompts). This architectural knowledge is not in the requirements document itself."}
