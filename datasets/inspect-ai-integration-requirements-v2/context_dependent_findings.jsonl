{"id": "problem-framer-001", "title": "Problem statement unchanged despite root cause being wrong in v1", "issue": "The v2 problem statement is verbatim from v1: 'no systematic way to measure effectiveness.' But v1 failed not because measurement was absent — it failed because the measurement architecture assumed skills were single-turn reviewers when they are orchestration workflows.", "severity": "Critical", "reviewer": "problem-framer", "required_context": "Requires knowing that v1 eval framework failed and what its root cause was. Not inferable from the v2 document alone."}
{"id": "success-validator-002", "title": "v1 detection thresholds (90%/80%) not confirmed or superseded in v2", "issue": "v1 established 90% recall and 80% precision as targets. v2 references these only in an example but never restates, adjusts, or explicitly deprecates them. It is unclear whether these thresholds apply to v2.", "severity": "Critical", "reviewer": "success-validator", "required_context": "Requires knowing that v1 had explicit 90%/80% thresholds. The v2 document does not state these targets and a reviewer without v1 context cannot know they were ever established."}
