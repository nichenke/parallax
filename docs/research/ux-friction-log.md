# UX Friction Log

Running observations from building parallax using superpowers skills. Each entry captures a moment where skill discoverability, triggering, or pipeline UX fell short.

These become requirements for parallax's UX design.

## Format

`YYYY-MM-DD | phase/skill | observation`

## Log

2026-02-15 | session-start | User said "let's start working on design" — brainstorming skill triggered correctly, but only because the using-superpowers meta-skill enforces checking. No indication to the user that it was about to trigger or why.
2026-02-15 | skill-triggering | User reports not always invoking all needed skills, and not knowing the "magic phrases" to trigger them. Discoverability depends entirely on LLM pattern-matching against skill descriptions — no user-facing menu or pipeline visibility.
2026-02-15 | meta | Needed to create this log convention from scratch. No built-in mechanism for capturing process observations while working.
2026-02-15 | brainstorming | AskUserQuestion multiple-choice worked well for narrowing decisions. But when the user had something more nuanced to say (stage-specific personas, finding processing workflow), the rigid format got in the way — they had to reject the question and explain in free text.
2026-02-15 | brainstorming | No visibility into "where am I in the brainstorming process?" — user has to trust the skill is following its checklist. Pipeline position is invisible.
