Is the root problem uncertainty about LLM semantic grouping quality? Performance concerns? Schema design validation? The phrase 'before full pipeline integration' implies risk, but risk is never articulated.", "why_it_matters": "Different root causes lead to different validation approaches. If problem is 'LLM grouping quality unknown', validation needs precision/recall metrics against ground truth. If problem is 'schema may not support needed fields', validation needs schema iteration. Current design tests mechanics but may miss the actual uncertainty driving the prototype.", "suggestion": "Add 'Why Prototype?' section: State the hypothesis being tested (e.g., 'LLM can semantically group findings with >80% accuracy') and the risk being retired (e.g., 'Pattern extraction may be too slow for >100 findings').

These are separate problems: (1) validate pattern extraction works, (2) resolve ambiguity in FR2.7 specification. Solving both in one prototype creates scope creep and unclear success criteria.", "why_it_matters": "If pattern extraction validates well but systemic detection approach proves wrong, prototype is simultaneously success and failure. Conflating problems means unclear disposition. Additionally, using a prototype to retroactively clarify requirements inverts the proper workflow - requirements should drive design, not emerge from implementation.", "suggestion": "Split into two phases: (1) Pattern extraction prototype tests FR10.3/FR10.4 as currently specified, (2) Systemic detection requirements clarification (separate spike) uses pattern extraction results to propose FR2.7 amendment.

If patterns are technically correct but too abstract for users to act on, or if cross-iteration comparison still requires manual analysis, feature may be unused despite being 'validated'. This wastes implementation effort.", "suggestion": "Add user-facing success criteria: (1) Pattern summary is more actionable than reading 15-20 individual findings (human evaluator test), (2) Cross-iteration comparison identifies 'resolved' findings without manual matching (test with v2/v3 review data), (3) Patterns surface systemic issues that weren't obvious from individual findings (retrospective validation with v3 summary)."}

Sample bias could validate an approach that fails in production. However, this is Minor because Open Questions section acknowledges empirical validation needed post-prototype.", "suggestion": "Add rationale: 'Sample size chosen to balance validation speed vs coverage. 15-20 findings (24% of v3) sufficient to test semantic grouping mechanics and schema compliance.
