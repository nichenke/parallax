Is this a fatal blocker? Can personas be tuned? Is there a retry mechanism?", "why_it_matters": "Without failure mode handling, unclear whether failed validation means 'abandon feature' or 'iterate on personas'. Affects MVP decision timeline and resource commitment.", "suggestion": "Add decision tree: If precision <70%, analyze false positive patterns and revise persona prompts. If recall <60% after 2 iterations, escalate to determine if requirement review adds value or should be deferred."}

Single reviewer bias could invalidate precision/recall measurements.", "why_it_matters": "Precision/recall measurements are only valid if 'ground truth' determination is reliable. Subjective manual review without clear criteria could produce false validation results.", "suggestion": "Specify review protocol: Define what qualifies as 'real gap' (would cause >2hr rework if missed?).

Without tolerance bounds, binary pass/fail creates brittleness.", "suggestion": "Clarify: '<30 min wall-clock time for 5 personas (excluding API retry delays >2min)' or similar.

MVP testing on 3-5 past brainstorms (retrospective) cannot validate forward-looking behavior.", "why_it_matters": "This is a key validation criterion that determines auto-integration decision, but MVP test design cannot measure it. Risk: MVP passes all other criteria but fails adoption in practice.", "suggestion": "Revise to measurable proxy: 'After using --light mode, user reports they would invoke it again on next brainstorm' (intent survey).

Could validate MVP based on catching 60% of known gaps while missing entire categories of silent failures.", "suggestion": "Establish ground truth via dual approach: (1) document actual rework from original sessions, (2) have separate reviewer (human or LLM) exhaustively audit design docs for requirement gaps.
